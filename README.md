# Gaussian-Filter-Median-Filter-Burring-Image
To remove noise, we use a simple median filter to remove the outliers, but one can use a different noise removal approach or artifact removal approach. The artifacts vary across acquisition systems (microscopy techniques) and may require complicated algorithms to restore the missing data
